## Synopsis

The Pet Adoption API is a project using the ASP.NET WebAPI and MVC stack.  Project is set and built with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition as it is open-source. Database and API hosted in Azure Platform.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Nobody likes to see animals be put down due to overcrowding at animal control centers and shelters.  We would like to see animals at these facilities be adopted at a much higher rate, and for those animals who were lost and found, for their rightful owners to be reunited with them once more.  We would like to thank the City of Lady Lake for their wonderful contribution to the project, as they are the project's pilot city.  For that, we are ever grateful!
